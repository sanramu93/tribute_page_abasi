          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            Tosin Abasi was born in Washington D.C. to Nigerian immigrants to
            the United States. Abasi is a mainly self-taught guitarist. He first
            picked up a guitar at his friend's house, simply strumming it and
            making up basic licks on the spot. At this time he was being exposed
            to some music through learning the clarinet in elementary school.
          </p>
          <p>
            He later began to rent hair metal guitarists' instructional video
            tapes from his local music store, saying that some "were videos you
            did not want to be caught watching" due to racy material in certain
            tapes. Abasi said that when he decided to learn the guitar, his
            father was "totally liberal about the whole thing and encouraging
            and proud" and in fact, bought him his first guitar.
          </p>
          <p>
            However his mother initially held a more conservative outlook. Tosin
            said in an interview:
          </p>

          <q id="#quote">
            My mom definitely represents more of the traditional immigrant
            mentality of education and conventional channels being way more
            important than a creative endeavor.

          <h2>Early Career</h2>
          <p>
            He was the guitarist for the Silver Spring, Maryland-based metal
            band PSI before moving onto join the technical metalcore band Reflux
            in the early to mid-2000s.During a Reflux show, Prosthetic Records
            noticed his skill and offered him a record deal as a solo artist.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first, he refused, saying he didn't feel comfortable with his
            skill level to write his own record. Afterwards, Abasi enrolled at
            the Atlanta Institute of Music and Media, a for-profit college.
            After graduating, he contacted Prosthetic Records asking if the
            offer still held.He then formed his "solo" project, Animals as
            Leaders, the name loosely being derived from the book Ishmael.
